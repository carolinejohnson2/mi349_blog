      <h1>About the Author</h1>

      <p>My name is Caroline Johnson. I was born on September 24th, 2001 in Royal Oak, Michigan. My hometown is Warren, Michigan, and I have lived there my whole life up unitl college with my parents, my older sister, and my eleven-year-old dog named Eddie. </p>

      <p>I am currently a Senior at Michigan State and decided to change my major to Information Science my sophomore year. Freshman year, I came in as a Dietetics major, but I soon started to think more about the future and what I would do with my degeree if i didn"t decide to be a dietician. That is why I am very happy with my choice now, as there's so many things I can apply Information science to. Here are my classes I am currently taking, as well as business classes for my business minor:</p>
